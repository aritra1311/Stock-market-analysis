Trade Automator is an app that automates stock selection based on some *selection strategies*, lets you *analyze stock data* and even uses machine learning(BETA) to *predict stock prices* for a given date of the month.

The app has 3 main functionalities-
*   **Stock/Crypto Data Analysis**
*   **Stock Selection Automation**
    *   **44-Day MA Trade Automation**
    *   **MACD+RSI Trade Automation**
*   **Stock/Crypto Price Prediction**


## 1. Stock/Crypto Data Analysis-
> This function helps to analyze a particular stock or cryptocoin by providing an interactive candlestick chart with *3 moving averages* and a buy or sell indication marker if there are chances of the stock to rise or fall.

These Automation functions are meant for *swing trading* strategies.

### 2.1 44-Day MA Trade Automation-
> This function automates the *Swing trade* stock selection strategy *green candle near rising 44-day moving average* and gives the user a dataset on entry-price, stoploss and target.

### 2.2 MACD+RSI Trade Automation-
> This function automates the stock selection strategy for trading based on [MACD](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/technical-analysis/technical-indicator-guide/macd) and [RSI](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp) Values.

## 3. Stock/Crypto Price Prediction(BETA)-
This function anazyles a stock/crypo data over a month and predicts the price for a day of the month, given by the use. The function uses the [SVR](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVR.html) model to predict the future prices.

## Lessons Learned

As a student learning different investment strategies and the basics of stock trade and investment have always excited me. Also being a student leaning Machine learning and Data Science, I wondered what if I automate the Stock selection strategies that I have learnt using my knowlwge of Data Science. So me and my friend started working on this project.
  
## Optimizations

Further optimizations are neccessary for the Price Prediction model.
Adding more automated trading strategies is required.
optimizations required for clean code.
